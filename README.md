# Cookiebot Wordpress Addons


Cookiebot Addons are plugins for Wordpress that make other plugins compatible with Cookiebot. 
The addons hook into the original plugin and render the cookie setting tags as advised by the Cookiebot guidelines at https://www.cookiebot.com/goto/help/.

Concurrently we are working with WP Core on what we believe is the real solution. A framework in WP Core that can signal the consent state to other plugins,
so that they can handle their cookie setting code without explicit support for Cookiebot, or other cookie plugins. If and when this will be implemented is unknown.

# How do I make my plugin support Cookiebot?
If you favourite plugins doesnâ€™t support Cookiebot you are always welcome to ask the author to add support for Cookiebot.
Cookiebot provides a helper function to check if there is an active, working version of Cookiebot on the website.
The easiest way for at developer to implement Cookiebot support is to add a check for Cookiebot where tags are outputted to the visitor. 

This can be done following way:

```php
$scriptTag = ";
if(function_exists('cookiebot_active') && cookiebot_active()) {
$scriptTag = '<script'.cookiebot_assist('statistics').'>';
}
```

A users consent state can be be aquired through Cookiebots JS API.

The following properties are available on the Cookiebot object:
